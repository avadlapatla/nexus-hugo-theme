## Configuration Basics

The Nexus theme is primarily configured through your site's `config.toml` file. A comprehensive example configuration file is provided at `config.toml.example`. Copy this file to your site's root directory, rename it to `config.toml`, and customize it to fit your needs.

### Basic Site Settings

```toml
baseURL = "/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "Your Company Name"

# Enable Hugo features
enableRobotsTXT = true
enableGitInfo = false
enableEmoji = true

# Site parameters
[params]
  description = "Description of your site"
  copyright = "Â© 2025 Your Company. All rights reserved."
  author = "Your Company"
  logo = "/images/logo/logo.svg"
```

## Layout Customization

### Section Ordering and Visibility

You can control which sections appear on your homepage and in what order by editing the `params.layout.sections` array in your config file:

```toml
[params.layout]
  sections = [
    "hero",      # Hero/banner section
    "services",  # Services section
    "about",     # About section
    "testimonials", # Testimonials section
    "blog",      # Blog posts section
    "contact"    # Contact form section
  ]
```

To disable a section, remove it from this array or set `enabled = false` in the section's parameters:

```toml
[params.services]
  enabled = false
```

## Section Customization

Each section of your site can be extensively customized through the configuration file.

## Colors and Typography

### Theme Colors

You can customize the color scheme of your site:

```toml
[params.colors]
  primary = "#1a365d"     # Primary brand color
  secondary = "#2d3748"   # Secondary brand color
  accent = "#3182ce"      # Accent color for highlights
  background = "#ffffff"  # Site background
  text = "#1a202c"        # Main text color
  headings = "#1a202c"    # Headings text color
  light = "#f7fafc"       # Light backgrounds
  dark = "#2d3748"        # Dark backgrounds
  borders = "#e2e8f0"     # Border color
  success = "#48bb78"     # Success messages
  error = "#f56565"       # Error messages
  warning = "#ed8936"     # Warning messages
  info = "#4299e1"        # Info messages
```

### Typography

```toml
[params.typography]
  headingFont = "Poppins, sans-serif"  # Font for headings
  bodyFont = "Inter, sans-serif"       # Font for body text
  baseSize = "16px"                    # Base font size
  scaleRatio = "1.2"                   # Scale between heading sizes
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with the example config**: Begin by copying the `config.toml.example` to your `config.toml` and then customize it.
2. **Test one section at a time**: Make changes to one section, preview your site, and then move on to the next section.
3. **Use provided options**: Stick to the provided options for layouts and styles to ensure compatibility.
4. **Optimize images**: Compress and optimize your images to improve site performance.
5. **Use relative URLs**: For internal links, use relative URLs (e.g., `/about`) instead of absolute URLs.

## Advanced Customization

### Custom CSS

You can add custom CSS to further customize your site:

1. Create a file at `assets/scss/custom.scss`
2. Add your custom CSS rules to this file
3. They will be automatically included in your site's CSS

### Custom JavaScript

To add custom JavaScript:

1. Create a file at `assets/js/custom.js`
2. Add your JavaScript code to this file
3. It will be automatically included in your site

### Custom Layout Partials

To create custom layouts for specific pages:

1. Create a new file in `layouts/partials/custom/your-partial-name.html`
2. Create a corresponding section in your content files to use this partial

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Configuration syntax errors**: Make sure your TOML syntax is correct, with proper quotes and indentation.
2. **Missing images**: Ensure all referenced images exist in your static directory.
3. **Form submission failures**: Test your contact form action URL to ensure it's working correctly.
